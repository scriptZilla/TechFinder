### Description:
TechFinder will be a one stop shop in order of finding small tech companies/startups and learning more about them. The hope is that this site will be useful in finding companies that one might want to intern/work at. If there is interest past the scope of the project, there are many addition features that will be included down the line.

### MVCs:
As it currently stands there are very limited MVCs within our app. 

We have a controller and a model for our future 'Users'. These will handle how users sign up/sign in/sign out later down the road. These will also play a role in how our users will be able to save their favorites. 

We have a controller and a couple of views for static pages. These static pages will contain information about us as well as any other 'static' information. This will also include each of the companies pages, as they will be entirely static.

We will also have a set of MVCs for our 'dynamic' pages. These pages will be the ones that the user interacts with the most. Ie, the map/list pages that can be filtered to view the various companies in many different ways.
